In the root backend project folder:

eGlamHeelHangout\eGlamHeelHangout
(where docker-compose.yml is located)


In the UI project folder:

Unzipping will generate the required .env file in each of these locations. Both parts of the application rely on environment variables for proper configuration.

docker-compose up --build


### Running the Desktop Apps

The desktop application is intended for the administrator, who manages the product catalog (adding, editing, and deleting products), views monthly revenue and age group analytics, handles giveaway creation and winner selection, manages customer orders, and can also edit their own profile information through the admin panel.
Navigate to the appropriate folder based on role:

eGlamHeelHangout\eGlamHeelHangout\UI\eglamheelhangout_admin
